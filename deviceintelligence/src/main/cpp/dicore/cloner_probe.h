// cloner_probe.h — F13 app-cloner / multi-app-launcher detection.
//
// All three readers below operate on /proc/self/* via the raw
// syscalls in dicore::sys, so a Java- or libc-side hook installed
// by the cloner (Waxmoon, Parallel Space, Dual Apps, VirtualXposed,
// Frida scripts, …) cannot intercept or rewrite the values we read.
//
// None of the three "decides" anything on its own; each just hands
// kernel-truth state back to the Kotlin facade, which compares
// against the corresponding Java-level value (Context.packageName,
// Process.myUid()) and emits a Finding (kind="uid_mismatch")
// when they disagree. That comparison is where the actual signal
// comes from: a cloner can lie about either side, but it can't keep
// both sides in sync without root.
